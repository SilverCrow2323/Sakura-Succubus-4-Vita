Port of Sakura Succubus 4 for PSVita

## Description
Ogasawara Hiroki was once an ordinary man, but his life has now taken a distinctly unordinary turn. Quite unwittingly, he stumbled upon a well-kept secret which flipped his humdrum existence upside-down: namely, that several of Japanâ€™s most famous female celebrities are succubi.

These succubi fall for Hiroki in droves, and soon he obtains quite the harem. His gaggle of adoring succubi include the two-faced idol, Ikue Ayu; the ditzy social media star, Cosmos; the sadistic businesswoman, Marina; the elegant actress, Hifumi; the cheerful tennis player, Hazel; and the aloof succubus princess, Yue.

After narrowly escaping a lifetime of imprisonment in the succubus realm, Hiroki is ready to kick back and relax. Ayu invites him on a vacation to her private beach house in Okinawa, and Hiroki is happy to refuse. The other succubi come along for the ride, and a week of summertime fun begins.
